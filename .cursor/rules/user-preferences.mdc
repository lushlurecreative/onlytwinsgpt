# User Preferences

## Deployment
- **Always deploy changes for the user.** Do not tell them to deploy to Vercel (or elsewhere). Either deploy yourself via `git push origin main` (triggers Vercel auto-deploy) or, if that's not possible, give them exact step-by-step deployment instructions.
- This project uses Vercel with GitHub: pushing to `main` triggers automatic deployment.

## Technical Instructions
- **Never assume the user knows how to do technical tasks.** If a task requires user action (e.g., opening DevTools, checking env vars, running a command), provide clear, numbered step-by-step instructions suitable for someone with no technical background.
- Prefer doing technical tasks yourself when possible (running commands, deploying, etc.) rather than instructing the user.
